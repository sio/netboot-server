# LAN boot server

## Components

### [docker]/ - Docker image for the PXE server

PXE boot server consists of multiple components (ProxyDHCP, TFTP, boot
program) which in turn require some non-trivial configuration. To simplify the
deployment and to ensure reproducibility all required components are packaged
into a single container image: <https://ghcr.io/sio/netboot-server>

Software packaged into this container:

- [dnsmasq] provides proxyDHCP and TFTP server
- [iPXE] is used as initial boot program. In turn it enables booting via wide
  variety of network protocols: HTTP, FTP, NFS, etc.

[iPXE]: https://ipxe.org

### [ipxe]/ - Sample boot scripts for iPXE environment

Boot server provided by Docker image needs to point to iPXE scripts to
actually boot anything. This directory provides a simple boot script that can
be used as a starting point for your own deployments.

[docker]: docker/
[ipxe]: ipxe/
